# Version Guarantees

steam.py follows semantic versioning ([semvar](https://semver.org)) with a public API described by the documentation you are reading on the rest of this site.

## Examples of changes

| Change                                   | Breaking |
| ---------------------------------------- | :------: |
| Adding a new attribute/method to a class |    ❌     |
| Changing a type to a more specific type  |    ❌     |

If a method is broken but fixing it is a breaking change, its not considered a breaking change

"it's not my fault that there's a breaking change in a minor release if valve already did the breaking first"
