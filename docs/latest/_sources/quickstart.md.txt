# Quickstart

A quick start guide for steam.py

(installing)=

## Installation

Installation should be as simple as:

```sh
# Linux/macOS
python3 -m pip install -U steamio
# Windows
py -m pip install -U steamio
```

## The Basics

steam.py being heavily inspired by and based on discord.py revolves around {ref}`events <event-reference>`. An event is
something you listen for and then respond to.

For example, when a trade happens, you will receive an event about it that you can respond to.

A quick example to showcase how events work:

```python
import steam


class MyClient(steam.Client):
    async def on_ready(self) -> None:
        print("Logged in as", self.user)

    async def on_trade(self, trade: steam.TradeOffer) -> None:
        if not trade.is_our_offer():
            print(f"Received trade: #{trade.id} from", trade.user)


client = MyClient()
client.run("username", "password")
```

## A Minimal Bot

Letâ€™s make a bot that replies to a specific message and walk you through it.

It looks something like this:

```python
import steam


class MyClient(steam.Client):
    async def on_ready(self) -> None:
        print(f"We have logged in as {self.user}")

    async def on_message(self, message: steam.Message) -> None:
        if message.author == self.user:
            return

        if message.content.startswith("$hello"):
            await message.channel.send("Hello!")


client = MyClient()
client.run("username", "password")
```

Lets walk through what this does:

1. We import the steam module, if this raises a {exc}`ModuleNotFoundError` see {ref}`installing` again.
2. We then subclass {class}`steam.Client` to create our own client `MyClient`.
3. We register an event {meth}`steam.Client.on_ready` in `MyClient`, which will be called after the client is
   ready. This event will print once we log in to inform us as such.
4. We then register another event {meth}`steam.Client.on_message`, when doing so we need to be careful to check the
   {class}`steam.Message.author` as steam.py fires an event for every message sent. After this we can check the
   {class}`steam.Message.content` to see if the message startswith the correct phrase of "\$hello" to send back our
   reply of "Hello!".
5. Finally, we instantiate `MyClient` and use {meth}`steam.Client.run` it with our steam username and password.

After saving this as `example_bot.py` not called `steam.py` as it will interfere with the library we can run the bot
and watch it come online using:

```sh
# Linux/macOS
python example_bot.py
# Windows
py -3 example_bot.py
```

## A Minimal Bot with ext.commands

Since code like this is so common steam.py comes with a powerful commands extension to aid with creating commands.

```python
from steam.ext import commands


class MyBot(commands.Bot):
    async def on_ready(self) -> None:
        print(f"We have logged in as {self.user}")

    @commands.command
    async def hello(self, ctx: commands.Context) -> None:
        await ctx.send("Hello!")


bot = MyBot(command_prefix="$")
bot.run("username", "password")
```

This will perform the same as the example using {meth}`steam.Client.on_message`.

Except with some key differences:

1. We import steam.ext.commands to handle commands.
2. We subclass {class}`steam.ext.commands.Bot` to inherit command parsing functionality.
3. We swap out the `if message.content.startswith("$hello"):` line for a command that is registered with the
   command's name using the {func}`steam.ext.commands.command`.
4. Inside the `hello` command we are able to access the context of the invocation using the `ctx` parameter.
   This allows us to use the {meth}`steam.ext.commands.Context.send` to send the same response.
5. When instantiating the bot we pass the `command_prefix` key-word argument to make the bot only respond when the
   message's content starts with the prefix "$".
